/* Grasshopper - Create the rooms

Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create
a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game.
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with
at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
  room__1: {
    name: 'odin',
    description: 'two',
    completed: 'all',
  },

  room__2: {
    name: 'odin2',
    description: 'two2',
    completed: 'all2',

  room__3: {
